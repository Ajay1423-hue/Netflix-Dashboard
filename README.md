This project involves creating an interactive data analysis dashboard for Netflix using Power BI, SQL, and Excel. The dashboard provides insights into various aspects of Netflix's content library and user engagement trends. 

# Project Objectives:
Analyze the Netflix dataset to extract meaningful insights related to content distribution, user preferences, and trends.
Visualize key metrics such as the number of shows by genre, release year trends, content ratings, and duration of shows.
Provide interactive filtering options to allow users to explore the data from different perspectives.

# Tools and Technologies Used:
Power BI: Used to create interactive visualizations and dashboards.
SQL: Performed data cleaning and transformation for efficient data analysis.
Excel: Utilized for initial data exploration and simple preprocessing tasks.

# Key Features:
Genre Analysis: Displays the number of movies and TV shows available in each genre.
Release Year Trends: Shows how the number of releases has changed over time.
Content Ratings Distribution: Analyzes the distribution of content based on ratings (e.g., PG-13, TV-MA).
